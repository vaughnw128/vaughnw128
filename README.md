Hello and welcome to my profile!

I'm Vaughn. Nice to meet you! I'm a recent graduate(?) of the Rochester Institute of Technology, and I'm currently a Security Engineer at New Relic. Most of the repositories on my profile are side projects written in Python that I did for fun in my free time, with a few red team tools mixed in as well. I primarily program in Python, but I'm working on expanding my repertoire of languages.

To contact me either ping me on Discord `@wauhn` or send me an email at `vaughnwoerpel@gmail.com`. I'm open to chatting about programming, homelabbing, cooking, anime, manga, you name it :)
