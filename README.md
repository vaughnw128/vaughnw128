Hello! 

My name is Vaughn Woerpel, and I'm a third year Computing Security student at Rochester Institute of Technology desperately searching for jobs.

Previously a Security Engineering and Analysis intern at New Relic.

Feel free to check out my repositories, but they're mostly dumb side projects.
